    "\n",
    "** You've been given a list of historical stock prices for a single day for Amazon stock. The index of the list represents the timestamp, so the element at index of 0 is the initial price of the stock, the element at index 1 is the next recorded price of the stock for that day, etc. Your task is to write a function that will return the maximum profit possible from the purchase and sale of a single share of Amazon stock on that day. Keep in mind to try to make this as efficient as possible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you were given the list of stock prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "prices = [12,11,15,3,10]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then your function would return the maximum possible profit, which would be 7 (buying at 3 and selling at 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "** Try to solve this problem with paper/pencil first without using an IDE. Also keep in mind you should be able to come up with a better solution than just brute forcing every possible sale combination **\n",
    "\n",
    "** Also you can't \"short\" a stock, you must buy *before* you sell the stock. **"
